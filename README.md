## SkillUp GenAI for Business Process Automation Specialization

Specialization - 3 course series

The GenAI for Business Process Automation Specialization equips business professionals, analysts, and career switchers with practical, no-code AI automation skills—no prior AI experience required.

In this specialization, you’ll explore how generative AI can transform business workflows—from drafting emails and processing documents to building smart automation systems that operate independently.

Over three courses, you’ll:

Build a strong foundation in prompt engineering and AI-powered task automation

Create multi-step workflows using no-code tools like Zapier, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude

Design and deploy AI agents that can analyze inputs, make decisions, and take action, just like a virtual teammate

Unlike coding-heavy AI programs, this specialization focuses on real-world business use cases. You’ll work with scenarios like customer communication, internal task routing, and operational efficiency, and apply what you learn immediately in your current role.

Throughout the program, you’ll develop a portfolio of working automations to showcase your skills to employers. You’ll gain the confidence to analyze workflows, identify automation opportunities, and deliver end-to-end AI-powered solutions.

Whether you’re looking to transition into roles like AI Automation Specialist, Business Process Analyst, or Digital Transformation Consultant—or simply want to future-proof your career—this program gives you the tools to lead with AI.
